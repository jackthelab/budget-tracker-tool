This application is a lightweight budget tool. 

Break spending into "buckets" and add or subtract from the balance with "transactions."

To run the server locally, makie sure to be in the root directory, install dependencies ('npm i'), and then execute 'npm run app' from the root directory.

*Notes -- You will need to define a DATABASE_URL and APP_SECRET in your own dotenv folder ('.env').

PURPOSE

  -- Learning and practicing GraphQL, Apollo

  -- Learning and practicing Prisma

  -- Working on playing with improvements I think would be nice on a budgeting app I actually use, such as recurring vs. one time buckets, essential vs. nonessential buckets, and deciding whether to transfer balances forward in time frames.
